# Sailboat Autopilot

This work was presented at the general examination for engineering schools (CPGE). It is focused on optimizing the automatic steering of a sailboat.
The TIPE was carried out in three phases. The first phase was dedicated to calculating a navigation route in order to provide a course for the autopilot at all times. The second phase focused on the physical modeling of the sailboat's behavior at sea. 
This model was used to determine the steering of the sailboat in the final phase using an autopilot algorithmically defined with a Petri net.
